# 'Who's That Pokémon?' BOT FOR DISCORD
A bot to generate random "Who's that Pokémon?" questions in your Discord server.

To generate a quiz:
- !wtp -> Generates a totally random quiz

To answer an active quiz:
- !wtp-its <poke-name> -> Gives an answer to an active quiz, if any

FOR USERS:

WILL BE ADDED:
- Possibility to generate a quiz with silhouette
- Possibility to generate a quiz given a determined Pokémon

FOR DEVS:

This project is so little that I didn't include any fancy package manager to manage libraries.
To install:
- Clone this repository
- npm install discord.js
- npm install pokedex-promise-v2

This will let you install all the libraries you need to launch the bot on your own.
